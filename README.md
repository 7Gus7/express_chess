October ‎2022 - November 2022

A small project I made with Unity and Visual Studio Code, which was a recreation of the chess board game.

- Imported sprites from the internet for a chess board and pieces

- Used C# to make game scripts for programming the behaviour of the chess pieces and changing the state of the game, allowing me to sharpen my problem-solving skills

- Composed the game by interacting with Unity’s tools to connect segments of code together, leading me to learning how to familiarize myself with the software quickly
